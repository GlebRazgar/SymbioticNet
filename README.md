## Project Overview ðŸ”Ž

SymbioteNet is a mechanistic interpretebility network that maps and interprets the primary model's circuitry. It does this by actively experimenting with "diffing" the primary models weights, and observing the subsequent behaviour changes. SymbioteNet is taught through

### To get started:
1. Create a conda env:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml

```

2. Install lfs:
```
# For Mac (using Homebrew)
brew install git-lfs

# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install git-lfs

# For Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install git-lfs

```

3. Pull the dataset:
```
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

4. Run the notebook to witness the Symbiosis :)

Further description:
In this project I train and test models on an MNIST dataset. The ground model A is a CNN that classifies digits 1-10 like in a traditional MNIST. I then train the  "Symbiote" model B (MLP) to adjust the activations of model A during infrerence according to what input I want it to inhibit in model A. To be exact, after training the model A, I train the "Symbiote" in a supervised fashion by providing it a single number from 1-10 which the model should discriminate by acting on model A's activations during inference such that it classifies all digits correctly, but never outputs the specified digit (i.e: if we input 1 into the Symbiote model, the output should always be 2-10, but not 1).
